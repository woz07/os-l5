# os-l5


Hi,
Could you check my OS lab5 and let me know if there are any issues that I could improve on

Go into `FinalCompleteLab5` and then go into `Lab5` and run either `partA.py` or `partB.py`, you can ignore the rest as they are for showcase purposes, like using `down` to go down into `test_dir` etc. Do read the code and the paper and you'll be able to navigate it easily.

Known issues:
You can go `up` as many times, even if it shouldn't be possible

And some other issues that are talked about in the pdf
